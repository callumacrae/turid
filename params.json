You can use it in your plugins like this:\r\n\r\n    db = shared[:db]\r\n\r\n    # To write data\r\n    db.put(\"key\", \"value\")\r\n\r\n    # To fetch data\r\n    db.get(\"key\")\r\n\r\n    # You can also get data from other plugins\r\n    # Say you want the user information from the location plugin in your plugin\r\n    db.get(m.user.nick, plugin: \"location\")\r\n","google":"","note":"Don't delete this file!
